## How to Contribute

### Adding Type Names

If you need to add new item names or include type names from mods that are not already listed, please follow these guidelines:

- **Mod Rating**: Only add modded type names that have achieved a minimum of a 4-star rating on the Steam Workshop.
- **Formatting**: Ensure that the type name adheres to the proper syntax and format for consistency and error-free integration.

Example of correct format:
```php
$misc = ['TypeName1', 'TypeName2'];
```

**Note:** Always include a comma between type names and treat each type name as a string within the array.

By adhering to these guidelines, you contribute to the maintainability and reliability of DayzBoosterz. Thank you for your contributions!
